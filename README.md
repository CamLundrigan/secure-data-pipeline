# Financial Data Pipeline

A learning project exploring secure data processing workflows. This pipeline demonstrates how financial institutions might handle sensitive transaction data from multiple sources.

## What This Solves

Financial data comes in many formats (CSV, JSON, XML) from different sources. Before it can be analyzed or stored, it needs to be:
- Securely transferred
- Validated for accuracy and completeness  
- Cleaned and standardized
- Safely stored in a database

This project explores each step of that process.

## How It Works

1. **File Transfer**: Simulates receiving files via SFTP (secure file transfer)
2. **Validation**: Checks data quality - missing fields, invalid amounts, duplicate transactions
3. **Database Import**: Loads clean data into SQLite for analysis
4. **Monitoring**: Tracks each step with detailed logging

## Learning Goals

- Understanding secure file transfer protocols
- Data validation techniques and error handling
- Database design for financial data
- Logging and monitoring in data pipelines
- Working with multiple file formats
